Hi all,

Apparently I forgot to reply to this mail.
The result of the survey can be seen here.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pF7nARxqRwrydpv6uOTw0laIe19GFnrzF8YdQWGWxtI/edit?usp=sharing

To summarize:
1)	Assignment: very useful
2)	Theory of modelica: useful
3)	Electrical exercise: useful
4)	A60 Demonstration: useful but too fast
5)	Debugging: quite to very useful but too fast
6)	Building: should be kept but difficult

A good idea from the comments is to give them a second assignment in which they have to use IDEAS (building) before the crash-course. 
This could also be done for the HVAC. For the HVAC, we could ask them a variation of the building library tutorial for Buildings.Examples.Tutorial.Boiler.

Greetings
Damien

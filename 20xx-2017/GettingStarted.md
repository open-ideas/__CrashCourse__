INSTALLATION OF MODELICA
----------------------------------------------------
You can install three different Modelica tools. Please install *Dymola* in order to be able to participate to the crash course. Additionally, you could try also *OpenModelica* or *JModelica*.

* *Dymola* (commercial software). Fill out this form to download the [demo (320 MB)](http://www.claytex.com/products/dymola/dymola-demo/). 
After installation you HAVE to install a c-compiler, otherwise you cannot run any model. You can download and install [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ compilers](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads), choose the C++ 2010 Express edition).
Test your installation by running a demo (eg open File/Demos/Robot, then click Commands/Simulate and wait till you see a graph.)

* *OpenModelica* (open source free Modelica implementation with lots of add-ons, see [www.openmodelica.org](www.openmodelica.org)). Follow instructions in the manual/tutorial to test your installation.

* *JModelica 1.10* (open source, free, python based implementation of Modelica, focus on gradient based optimization, NO GUI. See [www.jmodelica.org](www.jmodelica.org)). Check the tutorials to test your installation.
